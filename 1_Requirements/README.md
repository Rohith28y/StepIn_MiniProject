## Introduction

An calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

Here, In this project we developed a calculator program in C in which we perform basic operations such as arithmetic operations and other operators depending on the  Inputs given by user and operations are performed.

For Arithmetic Operations: we kept a choice user has to choose in between 1 to 5.

        1-Addition
        2-Substraction
        3-Multiplication
        4-Division
        5-Modulus

For Other operations: user has to choose in between 6 to 11.

        6-Power
        7-Factorial
        8-Square
        9-Cube
        10-Squareroot 
        11-Logarithimic operation


## Aim:
To perform the mathematical operations given by the user.

## SWOT ANALYSIS:

## Strength:
     •	Easy to use.
     •	We can solve all the complex mathematical operations which take more time.
## Weakness:
     •	Can’t perform other Scientific operations.
## Opportunities:
     •	We can further add trigonometric, exponential operations and conversions to it.
## Threats:
     •	Need continuous update when new features are available.
# Requirements:
## System Requirements
## Software Requirements:
     •	Windows Operating System
## Hardware Requirements:
     •	The Hardware requirements that we require for the software as follows:
           Ram: 8Gb
           Processor: i3 and above.
